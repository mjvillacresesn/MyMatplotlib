# What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

##  Pyber

Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, we decided to run some analysis as the acting Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, it is expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

Data contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Build a plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

Produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
