# Final Analysis

## Observable trends based on data

### Supply-Demand:
![Avgfare_numberrides.png](Ride-Share-Graphs/Avgfare_numberrides.png)
* We can observe that as the "total number of rides" per city type increases, so does the "average price" per ride increase; "price" then, adjustes at the point where the quantity demanded (number of rides) equal the quantity supplied(total drivers available).

### Demographics:

![tolfares_ctypepng.png](Ride-Share-Graphs/tolfares_ctypepng.png)
* We can observe that the "Percentage of Total Drivers"(80.9%) is positively correlated with the "Percentage of Total Rides"(68.4%) and "Percentage of Total Fares"(62.7%); the more total drivers available the more total rides occurring and thus the more amount of total fares received.

* "Rural" average fares are highest, then "Suburban", last "Urban", which are inversely correlated with the "Percentage of Total Drivers" available (2.6%), (16.5%), (80.9%), respectively.
